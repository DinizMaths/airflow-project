# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Introduction

This project aims to apply the concept of pipelines. A pipeline is a sequence of interconnected steps that are executed in order to process data or perform specific tasks. In the context of this project, the goal is to create a pipeline using Apache Airflow.

Apache Airflow is a workflow and scheduling platform that allows you to create, schedule, and monitor complex workflows. 

By using Airflow, you can create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent the desired pipeline.

## Docker
